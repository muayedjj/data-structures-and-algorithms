## Python 3

# **linked_list_zip**

A function called `linked_list_zip` which takes in 2 ar: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the value of the search key, or -1 if the element is not in the array.

## Approach & Efficiency

The arraay/list is looped through while:

1. Comparing the key to the mid-item/element, if equal, the index of said idem is returned.
2. Halving; meaning:

- ignoring the lower half of the sorted array if the key is greater than the mid-item)
- ignoring the upper half of the sorted array if the key is less than the mid-item)

If the previous loop desn't return an index for a matching item, ***-1*** is returned as an indicator that the key was not found in the ordered list.

Big O for both space and time for this approach is **O(log N)**.


[//]: # ( using a *`While`* Loop & *`If-elif-else`* statements)

[//]: # (Kepping it as simple as possible, the floor division &#40;`//`&#41; was used to determine where the middle of the original/input list is, and compare the key with the item at that index.)
