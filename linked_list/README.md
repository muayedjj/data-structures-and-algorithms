# Implementation: Singly Linked Lists
## Code Challenge 5

## Problem Domain:

**`Node`**

Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.

**Linked List**
- Create a Linked List class
- Within your Linked List class, include a head property.
- Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.
- The class should contain the following methods

1. _insert_
        Arguments: value
        Returns: nothing
        Adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.

2. _includes_
   - Arguments: value
   - Returns: Boolean
   - Indicates whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.

3. _to string_
   - Arguments: none
   - Returns: a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
   `{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL`
   
- Any exceptions or errors that come from your code should be semantic, capture-able errors. For example, rather than a default error thrown by your language, your code should raise/throw a custom, semantic error that describes what went wrong in calling the methods you wrote for this lab.
   Be sure to follow your language/frameworks standard naming conventions 



### The program should be able to do the following:
- Can successfully instantiate an empty linked list
- Can properly insert into the linked list
- The head property will properly point to the first node in the linked list
- Can properly insert multiple nodes into the linked list
- Will return true when finding a value within the linked list that exists
- Will return false when searching for a value in the linked list that does not exist
- Can properly return a collection of all the values that exist in the linked list
